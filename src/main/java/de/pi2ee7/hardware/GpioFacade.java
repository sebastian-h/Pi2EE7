/**
 * I guess this is like a factory for selecting the implementation of GPIO bades
 * upon the hardware the app is running on.
 *
 * There is a problem with developing for the raspberry pi locally on a normal
 * computer: the pi4j framework will constantly throw errors, running the
 * software was impossible (for me at least).
 *
 * I have selected the strategy of facade / factory to get the right singleton
 * implementation based upon the hardware architecture: arm / not arm.
 *
 * In case of running on an arm architecture (rpi) this bean always returns the
 * same instance of GpioInterface implementation enabling control of the
 * hardware.
 *
 * In case of running on any other architecture (eg: x86) this bean returns a
 * mock implementation of the GpioInterface doing no more than making some log
 * statements to represent what is going of with the led (like turn on, off,
 * getState and so on.)
 * 
 * This is probably not the best way to accomplish what ii was looking for.
