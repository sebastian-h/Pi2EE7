# Pi2EE7
Raspberry Pi in JEE7 Integration

This project tries to give me, and maybe some others, some insight into JEE7 development and the work nessesasy to integrate a raspberry pi into the mix.

Currently "we" support turning on one (exaclty one) LED. Sounds like nothing, well, give it a shot.

Roadmap (in no particluar order):

* switching remote controlled 220V Outlets via 433MHz Radio
* switching 220V "locally" via Relays
* record temperature, humidity and air-pressure
* integrate with googlemail and google calendar
* read rss feeds
* use some form of display (like 24 character LCD-Display or something)

lets see how far we come...

Currently this piece of software is developed on OSX and Linux using Netbeans and Glassfish. It is then run in "production" on a raspberry pi using IBM Websphere Liberty.

To accomplish these tasks Pi2EE7 uses the following frameworks or "external dependencies".
